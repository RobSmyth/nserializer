=Migration=
Product feature changes and code refactoring often change the data saved. New data may be added, the data structure may change, or types may change name. NSerializer is being extended to provide data migration to allow a product to maintain compatibility with files saved by prior version of the product.

Data migration is to allow an application to read a prior version's file and convert it to the current application objects. This is a work in progress, not all migration scenarios are supported.

==Supported Migration==

Currently NXmlSerializer supports migration with the following changes to application data types:

    * Namespace
    * Type name
    * New fields

Hopefully in future release:

    * Deleted fields
    * Field name
    * Split class
    * Merged classes (consolidation?)

Migration can be divided into either data movement (renaming, type splits/merging, deletion) or consolidation where data is processed to produce a new state. All of the above are the former.

==Type migration==

===Changed type and/or namespace names===

Simple refactoring or type name changes should not break compatibility.

====Example====

{{{
namespace Example
{
  class Foo
  {
    private int myField;
      :
  }
  }
}}}

Current version code:

{{{
namespace NSerializer.Example
{
  class Bar
  {
    private int myField;
      :
  }
}
}}}

Migration rules:

{{{
rules.ForType<NewFoo>()
  .MatchesTypeName("NSerializer.Example.Bar");
}}}

==Fields migration==

===New fields===

Currently supported. No configuration required. New fields with have null or default values.

====Example====

Prior (saved) version code:

{{{
class Foo
{
  private int myField;
    :
}
}}}

Current version code:

{{{
class Foo
{
  private int myField;
  private int myNewField;
    :
}
}}}

===Changed field names===

Supported.

====Example====

Prior (saved) version code:

{{{
class Foo
{
  private int myField;
    :
}
}}}

Current version code:

{{{
class Foo
{
  private int myRenamedField;
    :
}
}}}

Migration rules:

{{{
rules.ForType<Foo>()
  .Field("myField").RenamedTo("myRenamedField");
}}}
